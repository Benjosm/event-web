# spaCy models/data (if downloaded outside virtual environment or if installed locally)
# Consider if you're explicitly installing them into your project or globally.
# If using poetry to install them as dependencies, they might not need this.
# However, if you download them manually, they might end up in a local directory.
# For the provided plan, spaCy models are installed via poetry's URL dependency,
# so this might not be strictly necessary, but it's good practice for any local downloads.
